Abstract
Use free and open source scientific notebook software to perform analysis and 
record results simultaneously in a open, flexible, portable format for ease of sharing 
and reporting.  Fully worked samples can improve analyst and responder mentoring 
and education. Use of notebook templates can encourage good practices, uphold 
standards, and improve investigative rigor for better DFIR science and better 
incident response. Detail some configuration options and server platform notes for 
SIFT3. Propose workflow and methodology for how DFIR process and techniques 
are integrated into the notebooks and server environment and walk through a 
sample investigation in a notebook. 


1.	Introduction
1.1.	Digital Forensics
      Digital forensics is defined in the US National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-65 Guide to Integrating Forensic 
Techniques into Incident Response as "the application of science to the identification, 
collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving the integrity of the 
information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data." (NIST SP800-65 p 15 
REFME)
      In the introductory chapter of File System Forensic Analysis Brian Carrier 
explains his use of some key terms in a section titled "Digital Investigations and 
Evidence". He defines digital investigations and digital evidence in relation to computer 
investigation techniques and forensics science and distinguishes use of these techniques 
for forensics purposes specifically as digital forensics investigations (DFI) to distinguish 
them from other more general digital investigations and better align them with related 
fields of law-related forensic techniques such as physical crime scene investigations and 
criminalistics. Carrier explains, "A digital forensics investigation is a process that uses 
science and technology to analyze digital objects and that develops and tests theories, 
which can be entered into a court of law, to answer questions about events that occurred." 
(REFME Carrier)
1.2.	Incident Response
      In The SANS Institute Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handling 
course (SEC504) authors Ed Skoudis and John Strand define incident handling as "an 
action plan for responding to *misuse of information systems* (SEC504.1 FIXME 
REFME). 
      Incident response, then, is effectively applying those plans in response to an 
incident to reduce or remove incident effects on protected systems and organizations. 
Having prepared plans and using them well is vital to effective response. Not having or 
not using incident response plans is cited as the number one reason for ineffective 
response in SEC504. (FIXME SINS)  Another common failure is not taking good notes 
in an incident. This not only hampers effective reporting and communication within the 
team and to stakeholders, but may also interfere with the reproducibility of key results.
      Incident response decisions, and therefore the success of the entire process, rely 
on effective analysis and communication. Whether implied in the major phases of the 
standard Plan, Identify, Contain, Eradicate, Recover, Learn (PICERL) process or 
explicitly identified in a more complex process like that of DOD 6510 incident response 
pivots on analysis, its strength, and how well results are communicated to stakeholders. 
(REFME PICERL) (REFME 6510 CM process)
1.3.	DF in IR
      Security professionals and educators who make use of digital forensics techniques 
in incident response have coined the acronym "DFIR" for their specific application of 
using digital forensic science with incident response and it is common defined as "digital 
forensics, incident response". Another expansion of the acronym DFIR using Carrier's 
definition could be: "DFI in IR", using the tools and techniques developed for digital 
forensics science directly in incident response.
1.4.	IPython science notebooks
      The global scientific community uses a variety of software tools to aid research 
and analysis and many are available as free or open source software (FOSS) for free use, 
modification, and redistribution without license cost. FOSS tools are of particular interest 
in science because of the inherent transparency of source availability. FOSS tools are also 
often easier to customize and modify and the absence of software license fees removes 
many barriers to adoption that have slowed the spread of excellent commercial tools in 
the same fields. FOSS tools with a large community can develop very rapidly, as is the 
case with the Linux and FreeBSD operating systems (FIXME, better examples).
      In fact many popular scientific tools as well as an impressive selection of DFIR 
tools are written in the open source Python language including Volatility, Rekall, 
plaso^(SP). The IPython project started as a set of tools to use python and other 
languages for scientific computing, mathematics, and analysis (REFME IPython). 
IPython offers an enhanced Python interpreter terminal with built in editing, syntax 
highlighting, and auto-completion features and a sophisticated interactive notebook 
interface driven by the IPython core and using the same kernel. 
      The IPython system and its notebook format has become so widely used and 
successful with users of other science programming languages including R and Julia that 
a new project was launched in 2014 to better support the broader use and push the 
technology further. Announced at PyCon in July 2014 (FIXME) Project Jupyter will take 
over the infrastructure of IPython and brings native support for kernels in Python 2, 
Python 3, Julia, and R. As of early 2015, development of IPython 3.0 and Jupyter 
continues, and many of the new capabilities are already available in some form including 
the multi-user notebook Collaboratory, Google Drive notebook support, and ephemeral 
notebook server tmpnb (REFME Jupyter github).
1.5.	DFIR notebooks
      The IPython notebook with its power, flexibility, and transparency is an excellent 
tool to perform DFIR analysis, collaborate with teams, and report results.  The open 
source IPython application stack and notebook format allow leaders as well as 
investigators to understand and verify the machinery of the analysis workflow as well as 
any specific result. IPython notebooks smoothly interface not just with Python software 
but can also call out to other languages or use system commands allowing easy 
integration of any tool with a command line interface, the ability to read and write files, 
or network access. 
      Standard notebooks and supporting workflows can improve consistency of 
analysis amongst teams and aid reproducibility of results. Templates can encourage 
analysts to follow processes completely and consistent formatting of case tracking 
information and meta-data aid record keeping and can smooth handoffs between teams or 
shifts. Notebooks with good supporting workflow are self-documenting and the analysis 
and results in a notebook are inherently reproducible by loading the notebook onto 
another system with access to the same evidence and re-running cells or the entire 
notebook.
      IPython notebooks offer many features to enhance sharing your progress and 
reporting results whether formally or informally with documents or even slide show 
presentations. Notebook files can be shared directly or used for reporting and 
presentations using IPython features, optional libraries, and common office productivity 
software. 
      Notebooks features also support on-the-job training, mentoring, and formal 
education allowing analysts and responders to share best practices as blank templates as 
well as fully or partially worked samples. Current notebook software supports simple 
"pair analysis" with dual monitor or online collaboration systems and future versions of 
the software already in development offer multi-user capabilities for live collaboration.
      Analysts, responders, and their leaders can use these FOSS science tools for 
improved analysis and more effective response by using IPython notebook software 
customized to information security and DFIR such as that provided by dfirnotes.org. 
2.	Notebook Technology for DFIR
2.1.	IPython Technology
      IPython features a modular architecture that has made expansion and integration 
with other projects easier. With IPython 2.0 the kernel supports three user interfaces 
(UIs): the IPython enhanced text console, a graphical console powered by Trolltech's QT 
platform, and the web browser notebook interface. All computation takes place in the 
kernel and communication with the UIs uses a standard messaging framework. In fact 
multiple UIs can be attached to one kernel and thereby share code and data objects while 
multiple kernels can be run on one system and be isolated from one another.
      IPython kernels, UIs, and utilities are configured primarily through the profile 
directory. A default profile is created on install and additional profiles can be created and 
invoked with running IPython applications to select a configuration as in this example 
first invocation of IPython notebook UI.
       
      IPython first run creates profile
      After installation, ipython notebook will start the notebook server and open the 
default web browser to the home page displaying notebooks. A new notebook can be 
created and opened with one click and will load in a new browser tab with a new code 
cell open. The built-in logo header menus and toolbar will display unless configured not 
to in the profile or a notebook. With IPython 3.0 (Project Jupyter) notebooks can use a 
selection of different language kernels and there is a kernel selector in the default toolbars 
top right.
       
      (IMG Jupyter standard notebook header)
      A user interface tour is offered on first invocation that briefly explains the UI, 
highlights core notebook functionality, and directs the user to online help for more 
information.
2.1.1.	IPython notebooks
      IPython's notebook interface has proven quite popular since its creation in 2011. 
As explained by Helen Shen in a November 2014 article in the journal Nature, although 
many other commercial and FOSS packages offer a notebook interface or some of the 
same features, IPython is far more widely adopted. Shen quotes Ana Nelson, creator of 
Dexy (another scientific computing package), "IPython notebook has become one of the 
most widely adopted programs of its kind". Shen credits this in her article to it being free 
and open source (FOSS) and to the Python language scientific community and its annual 
conference SciPy.
      IPython notebooks have become increasingly popular with researchers and 
developers in just a few years. Many presentations and papers at conferences (not just at 
SciPy) use IPython notebooks (REFME) and some science weblog sites are published 
using notebooks including Damian Avila's site http://www.damian.oquanta.info which 
has many useful tips for using and presenting with notebooks (REFME). 
      More ambitiously some teams are using notebooks completely for their 
publications. In fact the newest IPython book by Cyrille Rossant IPython Interactive 
Computing and Visualization Cookbook was composed in notebooks and then processed 
for electronic and print publication as explained by the author in the Preface (REFME 
Rossant 2014).
2.1.2.	Notebook Architecture
      FIXME Code cell features ? Move or cut:
       
      (IMG python code cell, win5mem)
      IPython is written in Python but with versions 2 and 3 has included more support 
for using other languages. Notebooks have always supported use of essentially any 
accessible tool though shebang, line, and cell magics, and IPython 3.x can actually run 
kernels not just in Python (2 or 3) but also in other languages such as R and Julia. In fact, 
the technical and social support for using other scientific and statistical analysis 
languages is so strong within the IPython project and community that they have 
announced and begun an ambitious plan to spin off the notebook components into their 
own project, Jupyter. (REFME) (Rossant 2014, Perez 2014 Project Jupyter video)
      IPython notebooks are comprised of meta-data and cells. A single notebook can 
include cells input as code, Markdown , or  headers, and the  output in text, graphics or 
other formats.
2.1.3.	Notebooks Format
      The IPython software as well as the notebooks are free and open source, cross-
platform, and use an open architecture documented in IPython manuals. Notebook files 
are text encoded serialized objects in the popular JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
format. Although the internal format of the notebook is not guaranteed to be stable 
between releases (REFME), the JSON format allows for manual inspection and 
troubleshooting of notebook contents and various useful programmatic manipulations. 
For example, notebooks files check in easily to version control systems such as Git and 
Fossil and can be processed into other formats directly if more customization or 
automation is desired than is provided by the notebook application. (REFME Rossant 
2014 p25) In fact robust utilities for some of these transforms are included in IPython in 
the nbconvert package.
2.2.	Notebook communication and security features
2.2.1.	Notebook reporting & collaboration features
      The structure of the IPython notebook lends itself not only to ease of use for 
programming and analysis but includes robust support for documentation, reports, and 
even presentation. The cells of a notebook are configurable to different modes for code, 
rich text, or headers. Switch the mode of a cell with the menus or keyboard shortcuts to 
code, define multiple levels of headings, or to input full Markdown structured text which 
will display as styled rich text when the cell is executed.
      To share progress you can send an IPython notebook to colleagues as a file 
attachment or check it in to version control. Rather than sharing all of your work by 
sending the notebook you can process out an HTML rendering of your current notebook 
including input and output cells using the print preview feature (in the File menu). This 
conversion can also be done offline with nbconvert. Rendered notebook content can be 
shared using the system clipboard and generally pastes nicely into office productivity and 
messaging applications with formatting intact. 
      For presenting your findings the notebook software natively supports slide shows. 
Cells in IPython 2 and later can be marked as different levels of slide content, or to be 
skipped over in your presentation. Once slides are selected nbconvert can process out 
your notebook into a slides-only document in HTML or PDF or run the slideshow live in 
a browser using the Reveal.js framework. (REFME)
       
      [IMG react slides invoke with nbconvert]
      Hannes Bretschneider, a PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of 
Toronto, explains how to hide the input cells for notebook slides shows with HTML and 
CSS in a blog post from November 2013 (Bretschneider 2013) and provides a simple 
script demonstrating the technique.
      IPython notebooks offer also options for sharing completed results in notebooks. 
The nbconvert utility can use available system document processing tools to process 
notebooks in batch, for example as into portable document format (PDF) files with the 
pdflatex package. The notebook web UI features a print preview function using pandoc 
that renders the notebook to a static HTML document. This can be excerpted with copy 
and paste into productivity applications such as Microsoft Office or messaging clients 
with full rich text formatting and graphics or printed in the browser. The charting and 
visualization libraries available through notebooks can render out graphics files for reuse, 
such as this graphic from the win5mem memory analysis sample notebook.
       
      (FIXME IMG process chart from win5mem)
2.2.2.	Notebook security features: 
      The notebook software system has several security features starting inside the 
notebook files themselves. Since IPython 2.0, the notebook file metadata contain a hash 
signed by a private key specific to the individual installation. The private key is kept in 
the user's IPython profile. As detailed by the online documentation at 
http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/notebook/security.html this allows the notebook 
software to recognize notebooks that were created on that instance and in the security 
model these are regarded as trusted (REFME). Untrusted notebooks have restricted 
execution of cells to prevent rogue scripts and malicious code from running without 
permission. For example, an untrusted (foreign) notebook's cells will not execute 
automatically on load. A notebook can be trusted manually to remove these protections in 
the Web UI or on the command line with the trust utility.
      Although it is not recommended to expose the notebook server to hostile networks 
the notebook server software can be configured for authentication and encrypted 
connections to reduce risks of unauthorized access and intercepted communications. A 
shared login password's hash representation can be set in the profile via configuration file 
and the notebook server software can use transport layer security (TLS) for secure web 
connections if a certificate is provided. A support document explain the process and 
configuration options at http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/notebook/public_server.html .
      Another security system of the notebook software is the separate notebook 
viewer. Rather than enabling interactivity and computation, nbviewer is specifically 
designed to allow for reading notebooks without executing their content.  As explained in 
the FAQ, "The Notebook Viewer uses IPython's nbconvert to export .ipynb files to 
HTML." (REFME http://nbviewer.ipython.org/faq) A public nbviewer instance hosts 
many of the example notebooks from IPython developers and security researchers alike. 
The development version of nbviewer is now part of Jupyter and its source is available 
through their GitHub. 
      The Jupyter project has ambitious goals including multi-user notebooks running 
in public and private clouds, notebook software as web browser applications (eg in 
Google Chrome), and quick deploy temporary notebooks (tmpnb). There are details and 
active development on GitHub at https://github.com/jupyter.
2.3.	Notebook Server Platform 
      Although the IPython notebook system is fully cross-platform and well supported 
on most Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX systems, for consistency of tools and to reduce 
support issues a standard platform is recommended. The SANS Investigative Forensics 
Toolkit (SIFT) provides a wealth of analysis tools when installed atop a long term 
support release (LTS) of Ubuntu GNU/Linux with the sift-bootstrap package available on 
GitHub (REFME). The Ubuntu system package tools and python pip utility can be used 
to install all of the dependencies and optional tools to make good use of notebook 
software. SIFT version 3 includes IPython but additional utilities and libraries are needed 
for full notebook server use and some nbconvert functions. A sample install script for the 
dependencies is provided in the dfirNotes GitHub project.(FIXME)
2.3.1.	Offline
      One peculiarity of designing systems for incident response or digital forensics is 
that they must usually operate in restricted networks without Internet access or sometimes 
entirely offline. Although the Linux, IPython, SIFT software are entirely available online 
it is not recommended for an analysis system in use to (still) have Internet access. This is 
to reduce risk of contaminated analysis and lower the likelihood of malware propagation 
or attacker movement through analysis systems. Some simple preparation and additional 
downloads can smooth this experience for the analyst and should be done in combination 
with system hardening to prepare a notebook powered analysis server for response 
activities.
      The IPython notebook software uses the MathJAX JavaScript library to render 
equations in notebooks and by default expects to find the latest version of the library on a 
public network site. If this feature is not in use it can be disabled in the configuration or 
execution of the notebook software or if desirable the library can be downloaded for 
offline use easily (REFME). 
      Some analysis packages use profiles, such as the memory image profiles used by 
Volatility and Rekall. It is recommended to download the profiles needed for an 
investigation ahead of time and like all software these may need to be updated or 
replaced as upstream changes. 
      The live slideshow feature of IPython notebooks uses a JavaScript library React.js 
and looks for it online by default when running slideshows out of nbconvert. The React.js 
project provides instructions online for downloading the library and configuring for 
offline use as these are detailed for SIFT3 in an appendix (FIXME).
      All of the tools tested for this project were easily configured for offline use.
2.3.2.	Hardening
      Response and analysis systems should be hardened against the potential threats 
modeled in incident response planning and in compliance with any organizational policy. 
Many of the analysis packages have network services (beyond the notebook itself) and all 
should be reviewed. Follow best practices, review all services for need, and protect them 
with firewalls, tcp wrappers, and cryptography. Are you printing from your analysis 
server, sharing files, streaming media? Consider uninstalling any packages not used in 
your environment or standard work process to reduce the attack surface of your analysis 
servers. Finally, strike a balance between the offline or restricted networking 
requirements of these systems and keeping them patched for any security problems. 
Network services, file and protocol parsers, and systems dealing with malware or attacker 
artifacts are all at heightened risk for exploitation as detailed in SEC504.4 (REFME) and 
these analysis systems are all of those things at once.
2.3.3.	IPython profile
      The IPython notebook software is user configurable through the invocation 
arguments to the tools and through the IPython profile and configuration files. Defaults 
for settings like the IP address and port to bind the notebook server to, various security 
and privacy settings, and feature selection (eg disable MathJAX) can be set in the 
notebook configuration files within a profile. Scripts can be configured to provide 
additional features in this way. A file included in the default profile at 
.ipython/profile_default/startup/README explains how to add scripts that run with the 
application server startup, such as this example script from (FIXME) which logs all 
IPython commands (not just notebook cell entry) to a separate log file.
      FIXME customizations, like logging commands:
      .ipython/profile_default/startup/05_log.py (REFME)
      Startup scripts, and all profile modifications, should be used carefully and 
compatibility with all software checked. The example logging script uses Python 2.7 
syntax that does not work correctly under Python 3.
      Also available within the profile are file locations for custom CSS and JavaScript. 
The CSS file is used not only for styling of the notebook web UI, but also notebooks 
browsed through nbviewer or processed by nbconvert (REFME). Using custom 
JavaScript in the profile enables injection and manipulation of cell content, notebook 
metadata, and reconfiguring of the notebook user interface.(REFME) (FIXME example). 
These JavaScript APIs are available live in a notebook cells, but are limited in scope. 
Scripts configured in the profile will execute for each notebook opened or created and 
can be quite powerful.
      The dfirNotes sample install script creates an IPython profile for dfirnotes and 
configures some useful settings as well as a custom theme there. It's available in the 
GitHub project (FIXME). 
2.4.	Notebook powered DFIR Workflow
      An example workflow for memory evidence triage will illustrate the advantages 
of notebook software for DFIR. In this scenario an incident handler is presented with raw 
evidence and a report of suspicious behaviour, must quickly determine if an incident has 
occurred, and then report back to their team with recommended action. 
      Pre-configured templates support analysts in following process and provide best 
practices in executable form. For this example the template win5mem used is for 
Volatility powered triage analysis of a Windows XP memory image. The template 
provides a case data header, the basic investigation plan and some scripting and analysis 
code. The template and a completed sample are provided in the dfirnotes GitHub project 
(REFME).
2.4.1.	New investigation
      Upon receiving the case the handler opens a new notebook from the template 
matching the investigation, in this case Windows XP memory triage (win5mem), fills in 
the case details, and reviews the investigation plan. 
       
      (IMG case meta RTF for win5mem)
      Once the header cell form is completed in Markdown executing the cell with 
toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts renders it as rich text.
       
      (FIXME IMG caption me)
      The completed investigation plan should detail the questions to answer and 
contain any hypotheses to disprove for the case. For memory analysis in the triage 
scenario we use the methodology from SEC504 Day 5 (REFME SEC504.5 (2014 p42)
       
      (IMG imv plan from 504.5)
      After completing the investigation information block and saving the new 
notebook under its correct name, the handler updates the variable names specific to the 
evidence and procedure specifying the path to the memory image and selecting (and 
verifying) a Volatility profile for that image. Executing this code cell sets the variables 
we will use for the analysis.
       
      (IMG python code cell variables)
2.4.2.	Analysis
      Using the redefined variables the handler executes the code cells provided from 
the template to quickly complete the first stage of the investigation plan by enumerating 
the process and connections with a batch of Volatility queries. The output is then read 
into Pandas dataframes to plot graphs.
       
      (IMG process barh, win5mem)
      Based on the occurrence counts and details from the process and connection data 
the handler examines some processes and connections further and charts that data as well.
       
      (IMG IE ps connections, win5mem)
2.4.3.	Recommend action
      From the process and connection data and an understanding of the Windows 
platform the handler identifies suspicious processes and another host implicated in the 
activity. The handler summarizes the results with charts and brief statements and 
recommends action, in this case containment and further investigation. 
      (FIXME IMG results, win5mem)
2.4.4.	Collaborate
      With the investigation plan completed and results in hand the handler can consult 
with peers by sharing the notebook application session live with conferencing software or 
present to a group by using nbconvert to run a slideshow from the notebook. 
       
      [IMG react slides invoke with nbconvert]
      React.js loads the slides in a web browser application with navigational aids 
including a subtle progress bar at the top and optional separate display of speaker notes.
       
      (IMG susp procs slideview)
2.4.5.	Reporting
      Once any teammates' contributions are incorporated the completed notebook file 
can be saved (ipynb extension). The notebook can be checked into revision control, 
attached to an incident case record for tracking, or just emailed as an attachment. Plots 
and other generated artifacts can be created as independent image files in standard 
formats displayed in a notebook. The images are then portable on their own. This 
technique was used in the sample notebook for the graphs shown in this paper. , 
      Once analysis is completed the handler can pull some or all of the results as rich 
text into an office document via copy and paste and include the generated graphic files in 
formal reports.
2.4.6.	Workflow possibilities
      The workflow described is flexible enough to support teams of different sizes and 
capabilities and offers many points for possible automation through scripting and 
programming. A sample new case script is available from the dfirnotes GitHub project 
that includes some simple workflow automation hooks (FIXME). 
      More sophisticated scripts could incorporate user input to select templates, set up 
case meta-data, or even start background processing of evidence. Interactive forms are 
possible with use of the IPython notebook widgets and JavaScript. With even more 
automation notebook applications could be created and started on demand by remote 
invocation from an investigation management system like Request Tracker Incident 
Response (RTIR) from Best Practical. 
2.5.	Conclusion
      The notebook technology from IPython is a powerful toolset in its own right and 
can be easily and effectively customized to enhance DFIR activities by supporting 
stronger analysis, enabling better reporting, and by powering analyst and responder 
mentoring and education. Notebooks are a flexible interface to DFIR software and are 
already used by DFIR tool projects like Workbench and Rekall.  (REFME) and many 
sample analyses are posted by projects and individuals alike. (FIXME A selection of 
public examplar notebooks are linked in the dfirnotes GitHub project.)
      The IPython notebook and included data analysis packages bring DFIR data into 
the standard formats including Pandas Dataframe and HDFS (FIXME) used by 
researchers worldwide with science software packages of all kinds. This make DFIR 
notebooks a bridge that can link process driven DFIR practices with the impressive 
techniques of the emerging field of data science and take advantage not only of 
descriptive and inferential statistical analysis but also newer analysis technologies like 
map-reduce and machine learning to solve the challenges we face from processing ever 
larger data sets to defend today's complex systems.
